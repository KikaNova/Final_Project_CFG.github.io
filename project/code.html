                    <h2>I Origin</h2>
                    <p>I am from Slovakia and I am 29 years old (until August when I turn 30!) I am currently an English Lecturer but I studied Film and Screenwriting. One day I am planning to write a script but that may take a while &#128516. I also have a beautiful baby girl Silvia. Silvia is now over 6 months old but she was born over 3 months early so she is still very small. I would like to learn my skills to create a website about prematurity of babies and to gather some research about the topic. It would be nice to also add space for mums to support each other.</p>

                    <h2>Interests</h2>    
                    <p>Some of my hobbies are trekking and nature walks. My element is forest and any kind of woods. I also started painted in watercolours about 3 years ago but that is still very amateur and I like cooking when I have time. I love films and epic series as I studied cinema it is always part of me to watch movies and enjoy talking about them and analyse them. I used to do yoga when I had more time but with the little one I haven't had chance to get back. Hopefully, we'll be able to do more active things as soon as she can sit and crawl.</p>

                <p> This is Silvia. Sivlia was born on 11th of November 2021. I was only at 25 weeks and 5 days which meant that Silvia is an extreme prem baby.</p>

                <p>Depsite the tough journey at the NICU as well as at home struggles. Silvia is now discharged from Neonatal care and she is thriving and well!</p>
